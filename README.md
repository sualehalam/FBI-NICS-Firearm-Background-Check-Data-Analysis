# FBI NICS Firearm Background Check Data Analysis

## Basic Background about NICS System
NICS (National Instant Criminal Background Check System) is the system through which people undergo checks before acquiring a firearm. NICS is a national database maintained by the FBI. NICS checks are point-of-sale background checks that happen each time a firearm is purchased. NICS searches criminal and mental health history and other records to determine if the person is legally prohibited from owning a firearm.

## Data Description:
The dataset covers the time period from **January 2017 to December 2021**, providing monthly background check data for each U.S. state and firearm category.

Each column represents the type of transaction submitted to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).

## Questions for Analysis:
1. What is the overall trend of different firearm type permits (Declining or Rising in US) across 2017-2020 ?
2. Are handguns replacing long guns in popularity over time (2017-2021) ?
3. In which year did the United States experience the peak in total firearm-related permit background checks and what might this indicate about public sentiments?
4. What are the top 10 states with the most and least gun permits across US (2017-2021) ?
5. Which state had the highest total background checks for handguns, long guns, other guns and multiple firearm types from 2017 to 2020?
6. Which states had the highest number of firearm permit background checks from 2017 to 2020?
7. Is the “Other” firearms category growing, and what might this suggest about trends in niche/tactical firearms?
8. Do permit rechecks (renewals or ongoing monitoring) vary significantly across states, and what does this indicate about state-level firearm monitoring systems?
9. Do states with high handgun background checks also have high firearm-related incidents (crime/suicide)?


## Limitations:
The FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) counts initiated background checks, not the number of firearms sold. Therefore, a one-to-one correlation cannot be assumed.
